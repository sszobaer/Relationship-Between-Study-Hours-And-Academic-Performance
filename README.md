## **Introduction**  

Academic success is a primary goal for students across all levels of education. This study investigates the nuanced relationship between the amount of time spent studying and academic performance. Beyond raw study hours, it highlights the importance of factors such as time management, motivation, and effective study techniques.  

This repository organizes all the resources related to the research paper, from the methodology to the Python code for data analysis.  

---

## **Research Objectives**  

1. What is the relationship between study hours and academic performance among students?  
2. Why is understanding this relationship important for educational practices and student success?  

By answering these questions, the study aims to provide actionable insights into optimizing study habits for better academic outcomes.

## **Survey Questions**  

The study gathered data from 52 respondents using a 10-question survey. Key topics included:  
1. Regularity of study times.  
2. Study hours per week per subject.  
3. Use of effective study techniques.  
4. Management of distractions and stress.  
5. Seeking feedback to improve study habits.  

The complete survey is available [here](https://github.com/sszobaer/Thesis-About-Relationship-Between-Study-Hours-And-Academic-Performance/blob/main/Methodology/survey_questions.md).

## **Findings**  

Key findings from the statistical analysis:  
- **Study Habits**: Students who maintained regular study schedules performed better overall.  
- **Distractions**: Digital distractions were a significant challenge for many respondents.  
- **Study Techniques**: Quality of study methods mattered more than sheer hours spent.  
- **Stress**: High study hours often correlated with increased stress, suggesting the need for balance.

## **Data and Code**  

This study uses Python for statistical analysis, including metrics like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.  

### **Code Highlights**  
The Python script calculates:  
- **Mean**: Average response values.  
- **Median**: Central tendencies of responses.  
- **Variance**: Spread of the data.  
- **Standard Deviation**: Variability in responses.

## **Limitations**  

1. **Sample Size**: Data was collected from 52 respondents, limiting generalizability.  
2. **Self-Reported Data**: Responses may include bias.  
3. **Context**: Factors such as course difficulty and personal circumstances were not considered.  

Future studies should explore larger, more diverse samples and long-term trends in study habits.
