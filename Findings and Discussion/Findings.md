# Findings and Discussion

## Findings

Based on the responses from the 52 participants in the survey, several key findings emerged that highlight the relationship between study habits and academic performance. The data collected from the survey questions were analyzed, and the following observations were made:

1. **Study Time and Frequency**
   - A significant number of students (75%) reported that they set aside specific times each week for studying, with the majority stating they study for 4-6 hours per week per subject.
   - The analysis of study time revealed a positive correlation between students who study regularly and their academic performance.

2. **Study Duration**
   - The survey revealed that the majority of students (70%) study between 4 to 6 hours per week for each subject. Interestingly, a small percentage of students (10%) study for 10+ hours per week, which aligns with the students reporting higher grades.
   - This suggests that more study time may lead to better academic performance, though excessive study time, as indicated by responses to other questions, can also result in burnout.

3. **Study Environment**
   - About 80% of participants indicated they have a dedicated, distraction-free space for studying, which is in line with research suggesting that a conducive study environment contributes to better learning outcomes.

4. **Study Techniques**
   - Around 65% of respondents stated that they use effective study techniques such as summarizing, self-testing, and note-taking. This highlights the importance of effective study strategies in enhancing academic performance.

5. **Time Management**
   - The survey found that 60% of students reported being able to effectively manage their study time, balancing coursework, assignments, and other activities. Students who struggled with time management tended to report lower grades.

6. **Motivation and Academic Goals**
   - Motivation was found to play a significant role in study habits. Students who had clear academic goals (55% of respondents) were more likely to study regularly and report higher academic achievement.

7. **Distractions**
   - 50% of respondents admitted that they are easily distracted by social media or digital devices while studying. This finding aligns with literature on the impact of digital distractions on academic performance.

8. **Impact of Study Time on Grades**
   - Most participants (70%) agreed that the amount of time they spent studying positively impacted their grades. This highlights the relationship between study time and academic success, though the quality of study time was not explicitly addressed in the survey.

9. **Stress and Study Time**
   - A considerable number of students (55%) reported experiencing stress or burnout due to excessive study hours. This indicates that while study time is important, managing stress is equally crucial for academic success.

10. **Feedback and Improvement**
    - 45% of participants stated they regularly seek feedback from instructors or peers to improve their study habits. This underscores the value of external input in enhancing academic strategies.

## Discussion

The findings from this survey align with existing literature that suggests study time, study environment, and the use of effective study techniques are positively correlated with academic performance. However, several factors also need to be considered when analyzing these relationships:

1. **Quality vs. Quantity of Study Time**
   - While the quantity of study time is important, it is crucial to also consider the quality of the study sessions. Students who reported using effective study techniques such as self-testing and summarizing were more likely to experience positive outcomes despite studying for fewer hours.

2. **The Role of Motivation**
   - Clear academic goals played a significant role in motivating students to study regularly. This finding suggests that motivation, combined with structured study time, enhances academic performance.

3. **Distractions and Study Environment**
   - Although most students reported having a distraction-free space for studying, half of them admitted to being distracted by social media or other digital devices. This indicates that external distractions still pose a significant challenge, even in an ideal study environment.

4. **The Impact of Stress and Burnout**
   - The issue of stress and burnout is particularly important. Although study time is critical for academic success, managing stress is essential to avoid negative effects on performance. Further research should focus on the balance between study time and mental well-being.

5. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**
   - Seeking feedback was not as common as expected, with only 45% of students regularly seeking input to improve their study habits. This could suggest that students may not always be aware of the value of feedback in academic improvement, or they may not have access to sufficient support.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this study highlights the complex relationship between study habits and academic performance. While study time and effective study techniques are crucial, it is equally important for students to manage stress, avoid distractions, and maintain motivation. Future research should explore these factors further, particularly the quality of study time, the role of feedback, and strategies for reducing digital distractions.
